**This version supports ONLY small file uploads.**
Small Hi-C maps or 1D tracks can be uploaded, but we have implemented a size cap. However, published Hi-C maps and bigwigs from ENCODE (https://www.encodeproject.org/) are able to be visualized in their entirety.
<!-- and locally stored small bedGraph files. -->

To fully avail of the utility of HiCrayon, please [Install](/www/md_pages/installation.md) a local version of the app.
